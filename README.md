## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling
* **React Flow (xyflow)** - Library for building node-based editors
* **TypeScript** - For development

## âœ¨ Features

* **Text Node:** Supports a single type of message node for building conversational flows. Multiple text nodes can be added.
* **Nodes Panel:** An extensible sidebar for dragging and dropping new nodes onto the canvas.
* **Edges:** Connects two nodes to define the flow of conversation.
* **Handles:**
    * **Source Handle:** Allows only **one** outgoing edge.
    * **Target Handle:** Can accept **multiple** incoming edges.
* **Settings Panel:** Replaces the Nodes Panel when a node is selected, allowing for text editing of the selected node.
* **Save Functionality:** Saves the current flow state. Includes validation to prevent saving if multiple nodes have unconnected target handles (ensuring a complete flow).
